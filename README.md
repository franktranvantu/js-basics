Now you're going to take your first step into programming by learning three different ways to output messages with JavaScript: 
1. A dialog box
2. Writing directly to the console 
3. Writing to the current web page

Display messages in the console:

```alert("Hello world");```

```console.log("My name is Frank");```

```document.write("Welcome to my web page");```
